## Overview

_"Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean."_ - Ryunosuke Satoro

weUnion empowers workers, students, or any group of people united by a common cause, to quickly build an alliance and take action against violations of their rights.

### How?

weUnion is an application designed to make it easy for anybody to create a **union**, invite others to join.

**Members** can initiate and **vote** on **rights**, **grievances** and **actions**.

### Rights

A right is determined by members. Any member can declare a right and all members can vote to establish that right. Once a right is established it becomes a part of the union's embedded constitution and can only be rescinded by vote.

### Grievances

Any member can declare a grievance, but a grievance must be linked to the violation of one right.

### E-Actions

An E-Action will begin as an email that escalates up a **chain of command**. Any member can propose an e-action, but it must be linked to at least one grievance. Any member can vote on whether or not to execute the e-action. Once an action is executed it will gradually escalate until a majority of member agree the grievance has been resolved.

### IRL-Actions

An In-Real-Life Action becomes available once an e-action has been fully escalated. Members must vote to approve the irl-action. Once approved all members must act
