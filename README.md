## Overview

_"Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean."_ - Ryunosuke Satoro

weUnion empowers workers, students, or any group of people united by a common cause, to quickly build an alliance and take action against violations of their rights.

### How?

weUnion is an application designed to make it easy for anybody to create a **union**, invite others to join.

**Members** can initiate and **vote** on **rights**, **grievances** and **actions**.

### Rights

(This will be a bonus feature) A right is determined by members. Any member can declare a right and all members can vote to establish that right. Once a right is established it becomes a part of the union's embedded constitution and can only be rescinded by vote.

### Grievances

Any member can declare a grievance, but a grievance must be linked to the violation of one right.

### E-Actions

An E-Action will begin as an email that escalates up a **chain of command**. Any member can propose an e-action, but it must be linked to at least one grievance. Any member can vote on whether or not to execute the e-action. Once an action is executed it will gradually escalate until a majority of member agree the grievance has been resolved.

### IRL-Actions

An In-Real-Life Action (walk-out, protest, strike) becomes available once an e-action has been fully escalated. Members must vote to approve the irl-action. Once approved all members act! IRLs can also be escalated by vote.

## Technologies

weUnion's design should be optimized for phone and allow for members to easily invite others to join.

### The MERN Stack

The app is built on a MongoDB database management system, an Express web application, the React library to build out UI and Node.js runtime environment.

A key technology for the app's success will be the ability to send push notifications for invites and updates. APIs for this purpose include Amazon SNS and FCM.

Additionally, map and calendar APIs will be necessary to keep actions organized. This is a bonus feature.
